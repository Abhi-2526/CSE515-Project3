# CSE515-Project
Introduction:

This is the Phase 3 repo for Multimedia and Web Databases. At its core, the project seeks to extract underlying latent semantics from a database of images, finds the inherent dimensionalities, models different classifiers like NN, Decison Tree and PPR. We have also worked with the probabilistic relevance feedback from the user.
